## Files
### Firmware OTAU files
In this repository we provide official OTAU (over-the-air-update) files for our [Bosch Smart Home devices](https://www.bosch-smarthome.com/de/de/produkte/geraete/) with ZigBee protocol. These files are only necessary if your devices are not connected with a [Bosch Smart Home Controller](https://www.bosch-smarthome.com/de/de/produkte/geraete/smart-home-controller/).
